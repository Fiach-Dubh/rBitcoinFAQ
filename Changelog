General updating of links were made

Removal of samouri and wasabi mentions, as they are now depricated.

Addition of a starting section focused on Bitcoin Core node software and links, with some mention of software wallets and hardware wallets. 
Intent is to emphasis what matters in Bitcoin. ie run a node, verify, open source bitcoin only wallet best practises etc.

The exchange list was reordered to highlight the P2P options first, followed by Bitcoin only exchange options. The altcoin exchanges were removed.
This is an ideological choice you may not share. I admit that and am not ashamed to own it.

This is still a work in progress, open to suggestions for modification, hence this gtihub where PR's can be made in the open by anyone.
